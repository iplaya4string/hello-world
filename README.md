# hello-world

This repository is a tutorial, teaching me the basics of using GitHub.

My name is Jon Stout and I am aspiring to be a game developer. So far, I'm confident with HTML/CSS, and know the basics of Java, Javascript, Visual Basic and C#.

I'm hoping to make games in my free time, using GitHub as a platform for easily viewing and maintaining my work doing so.
